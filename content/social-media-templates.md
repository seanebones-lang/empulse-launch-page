1/ Why we built EmPulse 🧵

The music streaming industry is broken:
- Artists get $0.001 per stream
- Algorithms favor popularity over fit
- Mental health and music exist in separate apps

We're fixing all three.

2/ EmPulse pays artists $0.004-$0.006 per stream (4-6x industry average)

Real-time dashboard. Transparent payouts. One-click control.

Your music. Your rules. Your money.

3/ Discovery by mood, not algorithm

Set your mood. Set your energy. Find music that matches exactly where you are—or shifts you where you want to go.

No names needed. Just feelings.

4/ Wellness built in, not bolted on

Daily mood tracking. Journaling. Affirmations. Streaks.

Music and mental wellness, reinforcing each other.

5/ Beta is live at blue7.dev

Join 3,891 listeners and 1,247 artists building the future of music streaming.

Try it → blue7.dev
Join waitlist → empulse.music/listeners
For artists → empulse.music/artists

Excited to share what we're building at EmPulse 🎵

After years of frustration with music streaming platforms that extract from artists and ignore listener wellbeing, we decided to build something different.

EmPulse is a mood-based music streaming platform that:

🎯 Pays artists 4-6x industry average ($0.004-$0.006 per stream)
🎯 Enables discovery by feeling, not algorithm
🎯 Integrates mental wellness tracking into the listening experience

Why this matters:

The streaming market is $30B+ but artists are getting pennies. The wellness audio market is $10B+ and growing 30% annually, but it's completely disconnected from music streaming.

We're building at the intersection of both.

Our MVP is 100% complete and live in beta. We're actively building our artist pipeline and preparing for public launch in Q1 2026.

If you're:
- An artist tired of unfair payouts
- A listener tired of algorithmic recommendations
- An investor interested in music tech + wellness

We'd love to connect.
